What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A directory, .git, is created. It contains metadata about the files in the repository. You need to create the first commit on your own.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a workspace where you can add and review multiple changes that will go into a single commit. I think it will 
    help because you can make and undo changes without cluttering the log.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    You can run git status and git diff to view the files in the staging area and the changes between those files and the ones in the last commit or the working directory. All the changes since the last commit should be for one logical change. 
    
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Branches would help when you are trying something experimental that you might not want to keep, or you want to make a new version of the program.
    
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    The diagrams show the parents of the commits and how each one can be reached.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
 
    When 2 branches are merged together, the changes in both branches are combined. The previous commits along both branches are accessible.

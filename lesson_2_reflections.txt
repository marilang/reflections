What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A directory, .git, is created. It contains metadata about the files in the repository. You need to create the first commit on your own.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a workspace where you can add and review multiple changes that will go into a single commit. I think it will 
    help because you can make and undo changes without cluttering the log.
